if there are deductions based on the reason on the rubric, list deducted points as bullet points, following by the reason of deduction from rubric:

if you see anything else, not explicitly listed on the rubric, from the (code / output / error) that might be deducted, report where the chunk of code is, following by the your reason of why points might be deducted there
    Flag with ?
    $where_the_code_is_that_causes_the_potential_deduction$: $your reason of this potential
else (meaning no deductions):
    no need to say how good the code is, just report Perfect.
